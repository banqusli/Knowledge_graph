In manned aviation, the methods of determining the altitude of an aircraft are based on pressure altitude difference measurements (e.g. QFE, QNH and FL) referred to a common datum. 
The UA flights superimpose a new challenge, since a small drone may take off and land almost from everywhere, hence reducing the original significance of QFE settings, introduced on behalf of manned pilots to display on the altimeter the 0-height at touchdown on the local runway. In fact, the possibility for n drones to take off at n different places would generate a series of n different QFE corresponding to different heights of ground pressures referred to the take-off “Home points”. Therefore for a large number drones, new methodologies and procedures shall be put in place. The ICARUS defines a new U-space U3 service tightly coupled with the interface of the existing U-space services (e.g. Tracking, and Flight Planning services). The users of ICARUS service shall be remote pilots competent to fly in BVLOS in the specific category of UAS operations and ultralight GA pilots potentially sharing the same VLL airspace. 
The ICARUS proposed approach foresees the realization of DTM service embedded in an Application Program Interface (API) that can be queried by UAS pilot/operator (or by drone itself) based on the actual positioning of the UA along its trajectory, computed by the (E)GNSS receiver. The output of the DTM service would provide information on distance from ground/obstacles in combination with the common altitude reference.
Accuracy, continuity, integrity and availability requirements for GNSS-based altimetry together with accuracy and resolution requirements of the DTM to be provided by ICARUS service are key topics of the study.";1385286,25;1144587,5;H2020-SESAR-2019-2;SESAR-RIA;"E-GEOS SPA";IT;"TOPVIEW SRL;TELESPAZIO SPA;DRONERADAR SP Z O.O.;EUROCONTROL - EUROPEAN ORGANISATION FOR THE SAFETY OF AIR NAVIGATION;EUROUSC ESPANA SL;POLITECNICO DI MILANO;UNIVERSITA DEGLI STUDI DI ROMA LA SAPIENZA";"IT;PL;BE;ES";

applied to isolated contexts. The main objective of ISLand is to provide a new way of thinking about human interactions
within colonial empires and bringing colonial studies into dialogue with medical history and the emerging concept of
healthscaping. It seeks to do so by studying quarantine facilities in the Indian Ocean World during the long nineteenth
century, a crucial period for the history of European empires in that region and a flashpoint for the conceptualization of
modern public health. Quarantine, traditionally viewed as merely a mechanism for the control of disease, will be analyzed as
the outward material response to important changes taking place socially, ecologically, and politically at the time.
The project is a part of an international, interdisciplinary effort, combining history, archaeology, and anthropology. The
researcher will tap numerous archival sources and archaeological data from selected sites, examine them through social and
spatial analysis, and systematically analyze a test case in Mauritius through the most innovative methods that target
landscape and standing archaeology.
The broader impacts of ISLand have relevance for current European approaches to the migration crisis, where the threat of
disease has been ignited as a potentially debilitating consequence of immigration from extra-European countries. The
training-through-research project at the Stanford University, the top institution where acquiring knowledge and skills in
historical archaeology, will allow the applicant to develop into a position of professional maturity with a specific
interdisciplinary set of skills. With the support of the host institutions in EU, the researcher will promote historical archaeology
in European academy, stimulating new approaches in usual archaeological research and an interdisciplinary approach with
cultural anthropology.";253052,16;253052,16;H2020-MSCA-IF-2019;MSCA-IF-GF;"UNIVERSITEIT VAN AMSTERDAM";NL;;;

The need for upgrading the existing old and CHB is becoming increasingly important for the EU countries, due to: (1) their poor structural performance during recent earthquakes (e.g. Italy, Greece) or other natural hazards (e.g. extreme weather conditions) that have resulted in significant economic losses, and loss of human lives; and (2) their low energy performance which increases significantly their energy consumption (buildings are responsible for 40% of EU energy consumption). Moreover, the SHM of the existing buildings is crucial for assessing continuously their structural integrity and thus to provide information for planning cost effective and sustainable maintenance decisions. Since replacing the old buildings with new is not financially feasible, and even it is not allowed for CHB, their lifetime extension requires considering simultaneously both structural and energy retrofitting. It is noted that the annual cost of repair and maintenance of existing European building stock is estimated to be about 50% of the total construction budget, currently standing at more than €300 billion. To achieve cost effectiveness, STRETCH explores a novel approach, which integrates technical textile reinforcement with thermal insulation systems and strain sensors to provide simultaneous structural-plus-energy retrofitting combined with SHM, tailored for masonry cultural heritage building envelopes. The effectiveness of the proposed retrofitting system will be validated experimentally and analytically. Moreover, draft guidelines and recommendations for determining future research on the use of smart composite materials for the concurrent retrofitting (structural-plus-energy) and SHM of the existing cultural heritage buildings envelopes will be proposed.";183473,28;183473,28;H2020-MSCA-IF-2019;MSCA-IF-EF-ST;"JRC -JOINT RESEARCH CENTRE- EUROPEAN COMMISSION";BE;;;

When we listen to foreign languages, we may perceive them to be more musical, or rather more rap-like than our own. Even if we are unaware of it, the rhythm and melody of language, i.e. prosody, reflects its linguistic structure. On the one hand, prosody emphasizes content words and new information with stress and accents. On the other hand, it is aligned to phrase edges, marking them with boundary tones. Prosody hence helps the listener to focus on important words and to chunk sentences into phrases, and phrases into words. In fact, prosody is even used predictively, for instance to time the onset of the next word, the next piece of new information, or the total remaining length of the utterance, so the listener can seamlessly start their own speaking turn.
