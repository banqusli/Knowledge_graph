In manned aviation, the methods of determining the altitude of an aircraft are based on pressure altitude difference measurements (e.g. QFE, QNH and FL) referred to a common datum. 
The UA flights superimpose a new challenge, since a small drone may take off and land almost from everywhere, hence reducing the original significance of QFE settings, introduced on behalf of manned pilots to display on the altimeter the 0-height at touchdown on the local runway. In fact, the possibility for n drones to take off at n different places would generate a series of n different QFE corresponding to different heights of ground pressures referred to the take-off “Home points”. Therefore for a large number drones, new methodologies and procedures shall be put in place. The ICARUS defines a new U-space U3 service tightly coupled with the interface of the existing U-space services (e.g. Tracking, and Flight Planning services). The users of ICARUS service shall be remote pilots competent to fly in BVLOS in the specific category of UAS operations and ultralight GA pilots potentially sharing the same VLL airspace. 
The ICARUS proposed approach foresees the realization of DTM service embedded in an Application Program Interface (API) that can be queried by UAS pilot/operator (or by drone itself) based on the actual positioning of the UA along its trajectory, computed by the (E)GNSS receiver. The output of the DTM service would provide information on distance from ground/obstacles in combination with the common altitude reference.
Accuracy, continuity, integrity and availability requirements for GNSS-based altimetry together with accuracy and resolution requirements of the DTM to be provided by ICARUS service are key topics of the study.";1385286,25;1144587,5;H2020-SESAR-2019-2;SESAR-RIA;"E-GEOS SPA";IT;"TOPVIEW SRL;TELESPAZIO SPA;DRONERADAR SP Z O.O.;EUROCONTROL - EUROPEAN ORGANISATION FOR THE SAFETY OF AIR NAVIGATION;EUROUSC ESPANA SL;POLITECNICO DI MILANO;UNIVERSITA DEGLI STUDI DI ROMA LA SAPIENZA";"IT;PL;BE;ES";

applied to isolated contexts. The main objective of ISLand is to provide a new way of thinking about human interactions
within colonial empires and bringing colonial studies into dialogue with medical history and the emerging concept of
healthscaping. It seeks to do so by studying quarantine facilities in the Indian Ocean World during the long nineteenth
century, a crucial period for the history of European empires in that region and a flashpoint for the conceptualization of
modern public health. Quarantine, traditionally viewed as merely a mechanism for the control of disease, will be analyzed as
the outward material response to important changes taking place socially, ecologically, and politically at the time.
The project is a part of an international, interdisciplinary effort, combining history, archaeology, and anthropology. The
researcher will tap numerous archival sources and archaeological data from selected sites, examine them through social and
spatial analysis, and systematically analyze a test case in Mauritius through the most innovative methods that target
landscape and standing archaeology.
The broader impacts of ISLand have relevance for current European approaches to the migration crisis, where the threat of
disease has been ignited as a potentially debilitating consequence of immigration from extra-European countries. The
training-through-research project at the Stanford University, the top institution where acquiring knowledge and skills in
historical archaeology, will allow the applicant to develop into a position of professional maturity with a specific

The need for upgrading the existing old and CHB is becoming increasingly important for the EU countries, due to: (1) their poor structural performance during recent earthquakes (e.g. Italy, Greece) or other natural hazards (e.g. extreme weather conditions) that have resulted in significant economic losses, and loss of human lives; and (2) their low energy performance which increases significantly their energy consumption (buildings are responsible for 40% of EU energy consumption). Moreover, the SHM of the existing buildings is crucial for assessing continuously their structural integrity and thus to provide information for planning cost effective and sustainable maintenance decisions. Since replacing the old buildings with new is not financially feasible, and even it is not allowed for CHB, their lifetime extension requires considering simultaneously both structural and energy retrofitting. It is noted that the annual cost of repair and maintenance of existing European building stock is estimated to be about 50% of the total construction budget, currently standing at more than €300 billion. To achieve cost effectiveness, STRETCH explores a novel approach, which integrates technical textile reinforcement with thermal insulation systems and strain sensors to provide simultaneous structural-plus-energy retrofitting combined with SHM, tailored for masonry cultural heritage building envelopes. The effectiveness of the proposed retrofitting system will be validated experimentally and analytically. Moreover, draft guidelines and recommendations for determining future research on the use of smart composite materials for the concurrent retrofitting (structural-plus-energy) and SHM of the existing cultural heritage buildings envelopes will be proposed.";183473,28;183473,28;H2020-MSCA-IF-2019;MSCA-IF-EF-ST;"JRC -JOINT RESEARCH CENTRE- EUROPEAN COMMISSION";BE;;;

When we listen to foreign languages, we may perceive them to be more musical, or rather more rap-like than our own. Even if we are unaware of it, the rhythm and melody of language, i.e. prosody, reflects its linguistic structure. On the one hand, prosody emphasizes content words and new information with stress and accents. On the other hand, it is aligned to phrase edges, marking them with boundary tones. Prosody hence helps the listener to focus on important words and to chunk sentences into phrases, and phrases into words. In fact, prosody is even used predictively, for instance to time the onset of the next word, the next piece of new information, or the total remaining length of the utterance, so the listener can seamlessly start their own speaking turn. 
So, the listener, or rather their brain, is actively predicting when important speech events will happen, using prosody. How prosodic rhythms are exploited to predict speech timing, however, is unclear. No link between prosody and neural predictive processing has yet been empirically made. One hypothesis is that rhythm, such as the alternation of stressed and unstressed syllables, helps listeners time their attention. Similar behavior is best captured by the notion of an internal oscillator which can be set straight by attentional spikes. While neuroscientific evidence for the relation of neural oscillators to speech processing is starting to emerge, no link to the use of prosody nor predictive listening exists, yet. Furthermore, it is still unknown how native language knowledge affects cortical oscillations, and how oscillations are affected by cross-linguistic differences in rhythmic structure. The current project combines the standing knowledge of prosodic typology with the recent advances in neuroscience on cortical oscillations, to investigate the role of internal oscillators on native prosody perception, and active speech prediction.";191149,44;191149,44;H2020-MSCA-IF-2019;MSCA-IF-EF-ST;"UNIVERSITE DE GENEVE";CH;;;

This technology will help to extend the lifespan of asphalt pavements (roads) and will reduce the environmental and economic impact of roads and road maintenance processes. Recycling and self-healing processes will replace fossil fuel dependent technology. Self-healing will involve rejuvenating aged asphalt bitumen using a bio-rejuvenator developed using microalgae oils (rejuvenating bio-oil). Microalgae has been selected because of its fast growth, versatility and ability to survive within hostile environments, such as wastewater.  

ASAP will utilise microalgae, cultivated within the wastewater treatment process, as a source of the rejuvenating bio-oil. The solvent (Soxhlet) processes will be used to extract the oil from the microalgae. To ensure the efficiency of the oil extraction process, an ultrasonication process will be used to pre-treat the microalgae. The suitability of rejuvenating bio-oil as a replacement for the bitumen rejuvenator (fossil fuel based) will be ascertained via a series of standard bituminous and accelerated tests. A rejuvenator-binder diffusion numerical model will be developed, based on the Delft Lattice concrete diffusion model, to determine the conditions required for rejuvenation to occur and to ascertain the healing rate of the asphalt binder. These parameters will facilitate the selection and optimisation of the asphalt self-healing systems (specifically the amount of bio-oil rejuvenator and time required) to achieve full rejuvenation. 

This novel approach will benchmark the effectiveness of this intervention against existing asphalt design and maintenance processes and assess feasibility.

However, since finding mechanistic interpretations relating genotype to phenotype has proven challenging, the focus has shifted to higher-order regulatory features, i.e. chromatin accessibility, transcription factor (TF) binding and 3D chromatin interactions. This revealed at least two enhancer types: “lead” enhancers in which the presence of genetic variants modulates the activity of entire chromatin domains, and “dependent” ones in which variants induce subtle changes, affecting DNA accessibility, but not transcription. Although cell type-specific TFs are likely important, it remains unclear which sequence features are required to establish such enhancer hierarchies, and under which circumstances genetic variation results in altered enhancer-promoter contacts and differential gene expression.  Here, we propose to investigate the molecular mechanisms that link DNA variation to TF binding, chromatin topology, and gene expression response. We will leverage data on enhancer hierarchy and sequence-specific TF binding to identify the sequence signatures that define “lead” enhancers. The results will guide the design of a synthetic locus that serves as an in vivo platform to systematically vary the building blocks of local transcriptional units: i) DNA sequence – including variations in TF binding site affinity and syntax, ii) molecular interactions between TFs, and iii) chromatin conformation. To validate our findings, we will perform optical reconstruction of chromatin architecture for a select number of DNA variants.

Developmental progression requires the synthesis of new mRNAs and proteins in a coordinated fashion. Many posttranscriptional mechanisms regulate the fate of maternal mRNAs, but it is less understood how translational control shapes early embryogenesis. In eukaryotes, translation starts at the mRNA 5′ end, consisting of the 5′ cap and 5′ untranslated region (UTR). Protein synthesis is primarily regulated at the translation initiation step by elements within the 5′UTR. However, the role of 5′UTRs in regulating the dynamics of mRNA translation during vertebrate embryogenesis remains unexplored. For example, all vertebrate ribosomal protein (RP) mRNAs harbor a conserved terminal oligopyrimidine tract (TOP) in their 5′UTR. RP levels must be tightly controlled to ensure proper organismal development, but if and how the TOP motif mediates RP mRNA translational regulation during embryogenesis is unclear. Overall, we lack a systematic understanding of the regulatory information contained in 5′UTRs. In this work, I aim to uncover the 5′UTR in vivo rules for mRNA translational regulation during zebrafish embryogenesis. I propose to apply imaging and biochemical approaches to characterise the role of the TOP motif in RP mRNA translational regulation during embryogenesis and identify the trans-acting factor(s) that bind(s) to it (Aim 1). To systematically assess the contribution of 5′UTRs to mRNA translational regulation during zebrafish embryogenesis, I will couple a massively parallel reporter assay of 5′UTRs to polysome profiling (Aim 2). By integrating the translational behaviour of 5′UTR reporters throughout embryogenesis with sequence-based regression models, I anticipate to uncover novel cis-regulatory elements in 5′UTRs with developmental roles.";191149,44;191149,44;H2020-MSCA-IF-2019;MSCA-IF-EF-ST;"UNIVERSITAT BASEL";CH;;;

By combining these two strategies into a single procedure, the diversity, complexity and value of products can be further enhanced along with the efficiency and economy of their construction. In this project, Dr Satpathi will develop novel copper-catalyzed multicomponent couplings of unsaturated hydrocarbons (e.g. allenes, enynes) with imines and boron reagents.

Protein phosphorylation (PP) has recently emerged as one of the major post-translational modification in bacteria, involved in the regulation of multiple physiological processes. In this MSCA individual fellowship application we aim to bridge the current gap in the field for prokaryotes by unravelling the unknown regulatory role of PP on proteins involved in nitrosative stress (NS) detoxification in the model bacterium E.coli. We propose to examine for the first time both global protein modifications (e.g. phosphoproteomics) under nitrogen species stress, as well as characterize PP in individual proteins involved in NS response. We will construct a network model that reflect the phosphoproteomic changes upon NS in E.coli, that may pave the way for the design of new bacterial targets. Understanding how bacteria respond to the chemical weapons of the human innate system is fundamental to develop efficient therapies. We will pioneer research on the mechanism and the regulation of nitric oxide detoxification proteins already identified as phosphorylated, by analyzing how this modification influences their stability and activity in vitro and in vivo. This project opens up new research paths on bacterial detoxification systems and signalling in general, addressing for the first time the role of PP in these processes. The proposal brings together transversal and scientific skills that will enable the researcher to lead the development of this emerging field and position herself as an expert in the area, and aims at establishing the importance of PP in NO microbial response, a novelty in this field.";147815,04;147815,04;H2020-WF-02-2019;MSCA-IF-EF-ST;"UNIVERSIDADE NOVA DE LISBOA";PT;;;

No issue inherently requires political responses. Instead, political actors construct arguments regarding the nature of a given problem and connect them to particular policy actions. For example, and to preview PRODIGI's substantive focus, some see digital technology as a threat to democracy and advocate for stricter regulation, while others emphasize its potential to improve participation and argue that tighter rules stifle innovation. This phenomenon, known as 'problem definition,' has long been recognized as a fundamental aspect of any policymaking process. Theoretically, PRODIGI argues that the notion of problem definition needs to integrate the dynamics induced by digital technology, such as new forms of political communication that bypass traditional gatekeepers. The state of the art does not adequately describe these new dynamics. On the one hand, the literature on digital technology and politics has not explicitly recognized problem definition as a a key aspect. On the other hand, the agenda setting and problem definition literatures have not integrated the role of digital technology in their arguments. Specifically, PRODIGI pursues four objectives: 1) develop a theory of problem definition that accounts for the role of digital technology; 2) develop new methods to measure problem definition based on computational social science; 3) analyze problem definition in the case of policy responses to digital technology's implications for democracy; and 4) analyze the effects of problem definition on opinions using survey experiments. PRODIGI breaks new ground in two ways. First, it puts forward original theory and  methods to study a longstanding question that has acquired new relevance in digital environments. Second, it applies the new theory and methods to an important societal challenge, namely, how politics responds to digital technology's impact on democracy.'";2483765;2483765;ERC-2019-ADG;ERC-ADG;"UNIVERSITAT ZURICH";CH;;;

Current biomass use comes at a high cost, either in terms of land use (sugar/starch crops) or energy and chemical use (2nd generation biomass). On the other hand, bio-waste is massively produced in urban or rural context but almost not valorised, or solely in low-value applications, in part due to its heterogenous nature.
CAFIPLA tackles both issues by developing an integrated biomass valorisation strategy that combines the carboxylic acid and fibre recovery platform (CAP/FRP). CAFIPLA firstly optimises the separation of the easily biodegradable fraction and recalcitrant biomass, as input for the CAP and FRP, respectively. This allows the implementation of tailored valorisation strategies for both routes, which in turn allows the use of heterogeneous biowaste as input, while still ensuring high overall yields. In the CAP, research will focus on process control strategies to obtain specific spectra of carboxylic acids to feed into bioproduction of microbial protein, PHA or caproic acid biooil. In the FRP, fractionation into different fibre ranges will result in intermediates that can be valorised as packaging material or insulation. A TRL5 pilot will demonstrate the CAFIPLA upscaling potential.
CAFIPLA represents a radically new approach for bio-economy applications by approaching biomass use more pragmatically. This approach, which centres on the integration of two platforms, allows tailor-made solutions. This improves the sustainability and cost-effectiveness of pre-treatment (ambient pressure/temperature, low chemical use,
bio-waste as input material). CAFIPLA will furthermore study the biomass supply chain and the business models for future implementation.

Modeling the interior structure, magnetic dynamo, and thermal evolution of Uranus and Neptune has proven very challenging relying only on the Voyager 2 flyby data from the 1980s and ground-based observations. The key to improve these models is to investigate interfaces and thermal boundaries resulting from the properties of the material in their deep interiors. Hence, we perform molecular dynamics simulations on multiple scales to derive additional modeling constraints, which are experimentally challenging to obtain or even inaccessible.
We use accurate ab initio simulations to calculate a new equation of state to constrain the rock/ice ratio in planetary interior models. Subsequently, we fit potentials to the ab initio data to investigate up to 1 million atoms using classical molecular dynamics. For the first time, we are able to explore interfaces between the inner mantle and the core of an ice giant planet on a atomic level. The resulting thermal and transport properties will be used as essential inputs for novel interior structure and magnetic dynamo models for ice giant planets; particularly those in our Solar System.

The world’s coral reefs are being severely impacted on a global scale by rising temperature that has led to increased coral bleaching and mortality. It is uncertain that these unique ecosystems will be able to adapt to this unprecedented pace of warming. Coral reefs are often referred as the ‘rainforest of the ocean’ and their potential loss puts an astounding EUR 9 trillion of biodiversity and ecosystem services at risk annually. The major goal for the management of coral reefs is to both predict the ability of natural coral populations to adapt to future climate change and to assist this evolution, in order to minimise their loss. However, assisted evolution requires a deep understanding of coral genetics, which is still in its infancy. This is why the overarching project aim is to understand genes and pathways that lead to thermal tolerance in corals. For the first time in the world, the cutting-edge genome-editing CRISPR/Cas9 and CRISPR/dCas9 techniques will be developed in corals, and allow us to disrupt gene function as well as turn genes on or off, to identify thermotolerance-related functions. The project aim will be tackled by: (1) scaling-up the CRISPR/Cas9 method for high-throughput gene editing during the short annual coral spawning, and establishing the CRISPR/dCas9 method for gene regulation in corals; (2) editing corals using the two CRISPR methods to test the function of candidate genes. The research is topical and highly innovative in using CRISPR genetic engineering for functional genomics, which will strengthen Europe’s quality and attractiveness in R&I.

HippoFronThal aims to investigate the role of a specific thalamic arousal system in emotional processing. The hippocampus and prefrontal cortex are the core of an evolutionary conserved distributed system for governing experience-based behavior. Previously we identified a molecularly specific neuronal population within the dorsal midline thalamus, which efficiently convey arousal to large parts of the forebrain. These neurons are uniquely connected to the hippocampal-prefrontal system, possessing a strategic position to modulate hippocampal-cortical information transfer. The specific goal of HippoFronThal is to investigate, how neuronal activity of the dorsal midline thalamus interacts with network activity of the hippocampal-prefrontal system during emotional processing. To accomplish this goal, I will utilize molecular-genetic approaches to ensure anatomical specificity, perform high throughput electrophysiological recordings with outstanding spatio-temporal resolution, apply optogenetics to cell-type specific circuit interrogation with high spatio-temporal specificity, and use ecologically relevant behavioral essays to examine thalamic involvement in innate and memory related emotional processing.

It aims to broaden the conception of Italianness by investigating a series of cultural texts that can be included within a comprehensive definition of ‘Italian culture’, once this is extended to its migratory and diasporic manifestations. Since Italy’s unification, migration has affected a significant part of the population, who started leaving the country in search of better living conditions. Excluding from the study of Italian culture texts produced in the context of Italian migrations, whether written in Italian or not, thus implies the exclusion of a significant part of this culture. On these premises, TransIT draws upon multidisciplinary resources – literature, film, television, newspapers and magazines, sociological surveys and historical documents – and adopts an interdisciplinary approach to examining the evolution of Italian culture outside of Italy, with a specific focus on the experiences included within the Italophone and Anglophone worlds.  In looking at race- and gender-specific cultural witnesses, it seeks to redress the mainstream interpretation of Italian culture.
Engaging with universities in the United Kingdom and the United States, the project responds to the demand for revised and updated methods and materials for teaching Italian culture in transnational perspective. TransIT offers a novel set of teaching resources, moving beyond the conventional textbook and promoting an innovative and multi-layered methodology which encourages a dynamic approach to textual analysis.

The gradual loss of sea ice, increase in temperature, invasive species and compounding effects of additional ecosystem stressors are identified as likely causes of the observed turnover of Arctic species. Other issues of concern are the climatic tipping elements that are known to have affected the region in the geologic past, and that could well affect the region in the future, precipitating a regime shift of unprecedented magnitude. Predicting these changes in the Arctic ecosystem is hindered by several knowledge gaps, particularly in terms of mechanistic understanding of the coupling between drivers and responses.  At stake are two important marine ecosystem services that human societies rely on; carbon sequestration with its feedback to global climate, and fisheries production that is the economic lifeblood of many of the local societies of the Arctic. ECOTIP will map out past and present Arctic biodiversity and its response to external drivers, and the effects of expanding commercial activities in the Arctic under expected climate change.

This project will shed new light on the understanding of the fundamental properties and flow physics of these impulsive flows. Theoretical concepts that are used today, do not go much beyond those laid down almost 100 years ago. With today’s level of technology and experimental tools I will be able to break new ground in the understanding of these flow phenomena that are very challenging both experimentally and numerically. First, a novel-concept flow facility will be built, based on a high performance robotic arm; this robot arm can move and rotate various objects in a water-filled tank along prescribed trajectories with known acceleration and rotation. The fluid motion is measured using tomographic particle image velocimetry (PIV), of which the measurement volume can move along with the objects using auxiliary robot arms. New PIV approaches will be developed that measure fluid acceleration varied within the short times of these impulsive motions. Then a systematic investigation is performed on various impulsive flows where the rate of acceleration and rotation rate can be varied, in order to find new
and improved relationships between the measured hydrodynamic force histories and relevant flow quantities, such as velocity, acceleration, and rotation rate, and the time scales at which these phenomena occur. These will represent real-life impulsive flows. Experimental approaches and results will be used to validate numerical methods. The results of this investigation will fill gaps in our knowledge of impulsive flows, and give more accurate estimates of hydrodynamic forces. This will improve the prediction of structural loads and reduce failure and discomfort, with impact on aeronautics, wind energy, maritime and offshore technology.";2499567,5;2499567,5;ERC-2019-ADG;ERC-ADG;"TECHNISCHE UNIVERSITEIT DELFT";NL;;;

Such functions continue to be essential in the adult to maintain tissue homeostasis. Semaphorins use plexins as their main receptors for signalling and the semaphorin and plexin families together constitute one of the largest and functionally diverse of the cell guidance systems in vertebrates. We have gained some insight into the architecture and interactions which trigger semaphorin-plexin signalling, but fundamental questions remain and some of the most puzzling, and of potential clinical importance, concern the mechanisms of action of the secreted class 3 semaphorins (Sema3s), and their (co-)receptors. Neuropilin co-receptors play pivotal roles for Sema3 function and have been implicated in context dependent switching of cell guidance signalling outputs. There is an urgent need for information on molecular mechanism to underpin the design and interpretation of studies into biological function and clinical pathology. To advance the field we will combine structural biology and cellular imaging based approaches with functional studies (in house and in collaboration).

The research plan is sub-divided into three inter-related sections that aim to discover:
1. The structural determinants and mechanisms of action by which class 3 semaphorins exert differing effects on signalling.
2. The conformational state of the plexin ectodomain in different contexts and its contribution to signal outcome.
3. The mechanisms by which neuropilin binding can switch the outcomes of plexin signalling.

The most used therapies, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, non-analgesic anti-inflammatory drugs or colchicine, often present severe side-effects. In addition, in recent years biologicals have appeared, but they are extremely expensive. Therefore, novel therapeutic approaches with lower toxicity, higher tolerance and lower price must be developed to treat autoinflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Since the NLRP3 inflammasome is a key contributor of inflammatory diseases (including gout, pseudogout, metabolic arthropathies and multiple sclerosis), its targeting has become very relevant for the development of novel therapeutics. As part of our ERC project STePS, we discovered a novel activation pathway to the NLRP3 inflammasome, which opens new opportunities to use an existing line of compounds for radically new medical indications. Within STePS, we uncovered the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by the enzyme Monoamine Oxidase B (MAO-B) through ROS production, positioning MAO-B as a promising target to treat autoinflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Given that there are several MAO-B inhibitors (iMAO-B) currently used in the clinic for treatment against Parkinson disease, the use of iMAO-B represent a major opportunity to develop new therapies at low risk and a fraction of the cost. This ERC PoC MOBILISE will assess the technical and commercial feasibility of repositioning iMAO-B as a novel treatment of gout and other NLRP3 inflammasome-driven diseases. Within MOBILISE, we aim to explore the efficacy in vivo of iMAO-B, solidify our IP protection, perform an extensive market and competitor analysis and develop a detail business plan to define the optimal commercialisation route for MAO-B inhibitors in gout and other autoinflammatory diseases.";;150000;ERC-2019-PoC;ERC-POC-LS;"UNIVERSITA DEGLI STUDI DI PADOVA";IT;;;

Although relatively helpless at birth, infants undergo significant development in the first year of life in many domains. But how do infants learn so quickly? They likely gather information that is optimal for learning by systematically allocating their visual attention to specific types of stimuli. Allocation of visual attention can be (1) intrinsically driven to guide their explorations in the world, or (2) guided by other social agents. Moreover, infants’ intrinsic visual exploration may be dependent on the “hardware”: the brain. This project aims to develop a comprehensive account of how these mechanisms interact in full-term and pre-term infants. Visual exploration and attention is often disrupted in pre-term infants, which may contribute to developmental delays. Since the World Health Organization estimates that 15 million infants are born pre-term annually, it is crucial to investigate how infants visually explore their environment and how this can be promoted through social interactions. Research into infants’ visual attention has been conducted by scientists from various fields, but few attempts have been made to integrate these findings into a comprehensive framework. As such, the interplay between these factors remains unknown. This lack of integration causes severe gaps in our theoretical understanding, hindering the development of healthcare policies and interventions. InterPlay addresses these knowledge gaps by integrating previous observations into a comprehensive, longitudinal study. The findings will have implications for current scientific and therapeutic practices. If caregiver attention-guiding behaviours could compensate disruptions in pre-term infants’ visual exploration, this would offer great potential for interventions early in life. Furthermore, infants’ brain connectivity may provide a unique predictor for the necessity of intervention, allowing healthcare providers to act in a timely manner.";184590,72;184590,72;H2020-MSCA-IF-2019;MSCA-IF-EF-ST;"THE PROVOST, FELLOWS, FOUNDATION SCHOLARS & THE OTHER MEMBERS OF BOARD OF THE COLLEGE OF THE HOLY & UNDIVIDED TRINITY OF QUEEN ELIZABETH NEAR DUBLIN";IE;;;

Hydraulic actions, especially scour are the leading causes of their failure worldwide. Exacerbated by climate change, bridge failures induce fatalities and traffic disruptions with severe economic and societal consequences. To date, the lack of fragility functions and recovery models has prevented the development of a reliable framework for risk and resilience assessment of bridges exposed to hydraulic hazards. As a result, network operators are unable to prioritise restoration and allocate resources objectively and systematically. The ultimate goal of ReBounce is to fill this important capability gap by delivering an integrated framework for the quantification of risk and resilience of flood-critical bridges and the associated transport networks upon which they reside. To this end, the project will deliver for the first time in the international literature: (i) realistic and sufficient flood intensity measures for representative bridge typologies; (ii) rigorous fragility models that will dynamically take into account temporal variations of critical parameters, e.g. scour, debris built-up and ageing; (iii) novel multi-parameter restoration functions that will simulate the effect of restoration tasks on the capacity and functionality of bridges accounting for uncertainties in the idle times and resourcefulness; (iv) test-application of the developed assessment framework on two different road networks in the EU and recommendations for increased system resilience.

Their internal microstructure and macroscopic shape are thus determined directly by the processing history they experience. Such materials are all around us: in colloids, microgels, emulsions, foams, pastes, slurries, and their biological counterparts. They find widespread applications in foods, pharmaceuticals, construction, oil extraction, lubricants, coatings, etc. Despite this importance to so many engineering processes, we still do not understand how their remarkable macroscopic rheological (deformation and flow) properties emerge out of the collective dynamics of their constituent microscopic substructures: colloid particles, microgel beads, emulsion droplets, etc. Addressing key questions emerging from recent experiments, RheoYield aims to build new theories to inform and potentially transform our understanding of the rheology of yield stress fluids. Within a multiscale approach, the project will capitalise on rapid recent progress in understanding how microscopic rearrangement events cooperate to give macroscopic flow.

Identify the microscopic changes that take place in a soft solid as it slowly yields into a fluidised state. 2. Understand the profound influence of boundary physics on bulk yielding. 3.

Probabilistic graphical models, the topic of this project, are tailored to the task.  The models facilitate refined yet tractable data exploration by using graphs to represent complex stochastic dependencies between considered variables.  Models based on directed graphs, in particular, provide the state-of-the-art approach for detailed exploration of cause-effect relationships.  However, modern applications of graphical models face numerous challenges such as key variables being latent (i.e., unobservable/unobserved), lacking temporal resolution in studies of feedback loops, and limited experimental interventions.  Often arising in combination, these issues generally result in observed stochastic structure that cannot be characterized using the established notion of conditional independence.  As a result, we are left with only a partial understanding of which aspects of a system can be inferred from the available data, and we lack effective methods for fundamental problems such as inference in the presence of feedback loops.  The aim of the new project is to move beyond conditional independence structure to obtain a deeper understanding of the inherent limitations on what can be inferred from imperfect measurements, and to design novel statistical methodology to infer estimable quantities.

Prominent candidates to host liquid water are moons in the outer solar system, which can maintain oceans under their icy surfaces. The currently most effective way to identify such subsurface oceans is through effects of their salinity and thus electrical conductivity. The conductivity modifies the magnetic field around these moons through a process referred to as electromagnetic induction. Spacecraft measurements of associated magnetic field perturbations provided evidence for oceans within Jupiter’s moon Europa and Ganymede. Current analysis tools however reached an impasse. No scientific techniques are available, which provide quantitative estimates and uncertainties of key ocean properties when the effects of the dense magnetized plasmas around the moons are included.

The sourcing and disposing of such quantities without a significant environmental impact will not be possible, even if everything is bio-sourced and bio-degraded. Yet, on earth, there are >10^12 Kg of proteins (one of Nature’s polymers). They are sustainable because they are recycled in a circular way. If we exemplify their metabolism, proteins are decomposed by living organisms into their monomeric constituents (the amino acids, AAs); the cell machinery uses such AAs to synthesize new proteins that have little in common with the original ones. This is only possible because a protein is a specific sequence of AAs bound together by cleavable peptide bonds, i.e. proteins are sequence-defined polymers, SDPs. Nature reuses and does not degrade AAs, thus assuring protein sustainability. This project aims at showing that such a circular approach to recycle SDPs is possible for technologically-relevant polymers using engineering-sound laboratory processes. One aim is to show that b-Lactoglobulin, a milk protein used as a component for water filtration membranes, can be digested into its AAs, that, in turn, can be used to form Fibroin, a silk protein used in resistive switching memory devices. Fibroin will be converted into Keratin, a wool protein, that will be converted back into b-Lactoglobulin. Another aim is to perform the whole process within an automated and scalable robotic platform. The final aim is to expand this concept from natural proteins to DNA and non-natural SDPs.

Strong dipole-dipole interactions give rise to new ordered states of matter, quantum crystals. Many-body effects start dominating collision dynamics where even molecular rotational excitations are dissipated as angular-momenta-carrying quasiparticles within the condensate.
 Despite intense experimental efforts, these fascinating ideas remain in the realm of theory. The main difficulty in turning theory into reality has been the absence of general molecular cooling methods. Recently, we have demonstrated the first experiment where collisions between cold molecules trapped in a 1 K deep superconducting magnetic trap are achieved without laser cooling [Segev et al. Nature, 572 (2019)], opening a clear path to molecular evaporation. 
We here propose to cool molecules by removing the fastest ones from the trap and letting the rest thermalize to lower temperatures via collisions. This method has been used to produce atomic BECs and we are the first group reaching identical initial conditions that are necessary for the successful application of the evaporative cooling. Generality of our approach is the key to successful search for a suitable molecular candidate. As an alternative to evaporation we suggest applying direct laser cooling on magnetically stopped NH radicals. We are confident  that one of our approaches will lead to the long-sought generation of molecular quantum degenerate gas.

DOM is the largest food source on reefs, but cannot be consumed by most reef animals. Instead, microbes and sponges transform DOM into particles that re-enter the food web. These recycling pathways, termed the “microbial and sponge loops”, are understood as crucial ecosystem adaptations for reefs to thrive as biological hotspots under nutrient-poor conditions. However, the increased load of algal-DOM on degraded reefs has been associated with the inefficient growth of pathogenic microbes—the “microbialization of reefs”.
Sponges have been hypothesized to further stimulate this microbialization by feeding on increased algal-DOM and accelerating algal proliferation via the subsequent release of nutrients. Through this “vicious circle”, microbes and sponges may jointly promote the degradation of coral reefs even faster than the usual, and much more studied, suspects of climate change (i.e., rising seawater temperature and ocean acidification).
I aim to determine whether planktonic microbes and sponges compete over DOM (i.e., feed on same or different DOM components) under past, present, and future projections of available DOM. 
Thereto, I will characterize the composition of different DOM types (e.g., coral- and algal-DOM) and mixtures of DOM representing past, present and future DOM-producing communities and assess their availability (uptake) and utilization (metabolic processing) by planktonic microbes and sponges. I will further assess the ability of planktonic microbes to utilize sponge-processed water and vice versa. With this project I will lay the foundation to integrate microbes and sponges as understudied key ecosystem engineers into coral reef food web frameworks that will allow to elucidate the fate of future coral reefs.";253052,16;253052,16;H2020-MSCA-IF-2019;MSCA-IF-GF;"UNIVERSITEIT VAN AMSTERDAM";NL;;;

If not treated immediately, it can result in multiple organ failure and death. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), sepsis affects approximately 30 million people worldwide every year, leading to potentially 6 million deaths. The main challenges associated with this condition are that it is, on the one hand, challenging to diagnose in its early stages when it is still potentially reversible, and, on the other hand, it is often confused with non-life-threatening diseases such as flu or gastroenteritis. Current clinical approaches to diagnose sepsis in low-complexity healthcare settings (where most patients are admitted at first) fail to provide the required sensitivity and specificity to overcome these challenges. Portable, fast and economical technologies that help to infer sepsis accurately are therefore vital to tackle these challenges.  
This project aims to develop a portable, low-cost microfluidic platform which has the capability to detect sepsis under 1 hour and has sensitivity and specificity levels above 90%. This platform is based on the quantification of several blood rheological parameters that are affected by this pathology. Previous research has shown that these parameters have clinical relevance for the early diagnosis of sepsis.

Here, the built environment is of obvious importance as it not only facilitates societal activity but also has a major share on the worldwide turnover of economic and environmental resources.  To date the built environment is developed and maintained by broadly following structural design standards, which did evolve continuously over time and contain safety concepts that support daily structural engineering decision making based on simple calculus. The major objective that has been followed in their development, was the provision of sufficient safety, and the observed relative low failure rates do proof success in this regard. However, as conceived, structural design codes do not allow for the optimal allocation of the limited financial and environmental resources into the structural performance. In this context, the proposed project will develop methodologies to calibrate the safety concept of existing design standards, such that their broad implementation will lead to a significant increase of resource efficiency with simultaneous conservation of the present average safety level. Environmental, economic and societal aspects will be explicitly considered and the potential benefits will be exemplified on the building stocks of two European countries.

In this project, WDW (the ESCO) will apply this model at district level to four different end user groups, launching €47M of energy efficiency investments in three districts in the Gelderland province. This district level approach has major advantages, such as:
•        Reaching a sufficient project aggregation level to attract private investors and to provide over-demanded contractors with large scale efficient projects
•        Reaching higher conversion rates among participants (peer pressure, FOMO)
•        Ability to offer cheaper and more efficient district-level technical solutions
•        Efficiency gains, both in time and money, due to economies of scale
By combining clever financial engineering solutions such as project aggregation, a revolving fund and on-bill financing, DistrictEES will have significant impact on the market, both in terms of direct energy savings and as a result of the showcase element that comes with a district level EPC renovation project that is cofunded by private investors.
This project enables WDW to overcome financial, legal and organisational barriers for the DistrictEES concept, enabling accelerated roll-out of the Energy Efficiency Subscriptions model. By implementing the concept at district level on a €47M scale, WDW can fully capitalise on the potential of the district level approach and at the same time attract private investors.

The traceless incorporation of carbon-14 allows tracking organic molecules and provides vital knowledge on their fate. This information is critical for pharmaceutical development, crop science and human food safety evaluation. Surprisingly, carbon radiolabeling still represents a bottleneck and an unsolved fundamental problem. In fact, current synthetic strategies are marred by several major drawbacks, including the generation of radioactive waste, being multi-step time-consuming and high resource-demanding. To circumvent such disadvantages, I present FASTLabEx, a novel approach for the straightforward preparation of carbon-labeled complex organic molecules that introduces the radioactive tag at the ultimate-stage of the synthesis. Inspired by efficient metal-catalyzed transformations, FASTLabEx makes use of a novel paradigm of “carbon isotope exchange”, defined as the selective replacement of molecular moieties into organic molecules, by reversible molecular deconstruction/reconstruction in presence of an appropriate radiolabeled moiety. FASTLabEx will explore this concept onto a large variety of functional groups and structural diversity, far beyond the case of carboxylic acids. This approach has the potential to streamline the radio-synthesis of pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. Outcomes from FASTLabEx will have a tangible societal impact not only for the radiochemical community, but also for pharmaceutical and agrochemical industries and in fine the consumers and patients.

The proposed project will focus on precisely that question, in an attempt to unravel what is perhaps the most enigmatic episode of ‘Great Wall’ construction. Roughly dated to the 10th-13th centuries CE and located far to the north of other ‘Great Wall’ lines, this Medieval Wall System (MWS) is one of the longest walls ever constructed in world history, stretching over more than 3,500 km and including large auxiliary structures (Fig. 1). The amount of resources invested in this MWS must have been enormous, but historical sources are mute about its construction, and modern scholarship is unable to date it precisely or understand why it was built and how it functioned.  The motives behind the construction of the MWS, its political context and ecological implications, are highly relevant for the understanding of the complex history of China and Mongolia on the eve of Chinggis Khan’s rise to power.

Hence, the proposed project will put forward novel hypotheses, analyse them by using advanced recovery and analytical methods, and examine them against a broad archaeological, historical, environmental, and geographical background. The research hypothesis of the proposed project is that the MWS was not built as a defence against invading armies, but rather as a means to monitor and sometimes stop the movement of nomadic people and their herds.

Currently, structural and energy retrofitting of buildings is treated separately with no established holistic approach. An integrated retrofitting system using advanced composite materials combined with thermal insulation can improve the seismic and energy performance of buildings and offer savings in application costs (>25%). 
During the last two decades, the use of fibre-reinforced composite materials for structural retrofitting applications has gained popularity. The recent generations of advanced composites for construction have proven to be very effective in seismic retrofitting of structures. However, they are often expensive, lead to incompatibility issues, and promote the use of cement-based binders, of which the production largely contributes to the global CO2 emissions (5% of global man-made CO2 emissions).

PAT, on the other hand, can image skin blood vessels with a coarser resolution from 1 mm down to 5 mm below the skin surface.  An imaging probe will be designed to combine these two modalities for patient imaging. To develop all the vessel extraction and vessel quantification algorithms, several types of skin phantoms will be 3D printed.

The implications of forgiveness are not limited to moral or religious issues, but also involve social, political and legal aspects that further complicate the widely disparate interpretations of its conditions (acknowledgement of fault, repentance, etc.) and purposes (reconciliation, social cohesion, justice, etc.).

FORGIVEBASQ aims to study the uses of forgiveness in the Basque conflict and its role in the current peace process. Firstly, I will develop a theoretical framework on forgiveness by adopting a philosophical approach that incorporates a transversal moral, political and social perspective and helps to illustrate its complex transformations and diverse practices. This transdisciplinary theoretical framework will be articulated around three axes: history, areas and conditions/purposes of forgiveness. Secondly, a diachronic study of forgiveness in the Basque context will be carried out by means of a documentary analysis. This will serve to identify and explain how forgiveness has been present in the Basque conflict, what role it plays in the peace process, how it has evolved and been transformed, and the key points at which forgiveness emerged in the political and social debate.

In the fermentation process robust mixes of naturally occurring micro-organisms will produce organic acids such as propionic, butyric, isobutyric, valeric, isovaleric and caproic acids, with a mineral fertilizer sidestream. Based on the acids, a substantial number of derivatives may be produced, such as Vinyl Acetate Monomer (VAM) and cellulose acetate. The esterification process will convert the acetic acid into ethyl acetate and the propionic acid into ethyl propionate to maximize product value and minimize waste and energy use.
The feedstock of the fermentation process may be sugar production byproducts such as beet pulp and molasses, to increase the sustainability of sugar beet, a key European crop. The products will represent valuable renewable, bio-based, domestically-sourced alternatives to petrochemical products in numerous high-value applications such as flavorings and fragrances, hygiene products, pharmaceuticals, antimicrobials and polymers. The mineral fertilizer sidestream will contribute to the EU Action plan for the Circular Economy. The objective from 2020 to 2022 will be to commission the flagship biorefinery in France, which will then run at full capacity and integrate esterification from 2022 to 2024.

Despite causing severe life-threatening infections, very little is known about the basic biology and pathogenesis of TPA, largely as the result of the inability to routinely propagate it in vitro. 
The recently described in vitro culture model (containing rabbit epithelial cells) has opened new avenues for the study of the basic biology of this pathogen. The ultimate goal of my research proposal is to take advantage of the in vitro model and link its use to high throughput genomic approaches to provide unique insights into the gene expression profiles of this pathogen. This has been transformative for other bacteria, enhancing our knowledge of genetic regulation: essential genes vs differentially expressed genes and intra- and inter-strain differences in response to different growth conditions. This has not been possible until now for TPA. Here, I will perform dual RNA-seq of multiple strains grown in vitro under different conditions. This research proposal has three aims. First, to describe global gene expression patterns of phylogenetically selected TPA strains. Second, to describe genome-wide interaction-linked transcriptional alterations of the infected host cells. And lastly, to correlate the whole transcriptome data with genomic and allelic diversity we see in circulating clinical TPA populations. 
This project will generate novel fundamental data which can lead to identification of functional pathways and prediction of the function for hypothetical genes, give light to the patterns of selection we see in genomic data and a better understanding of the key growth dependencies that could inform future axenic cultivation of TPA and combined a better understanding of basic biology introduce a more mechanistic understanding to surveillance and genomic epidemiology.";212933,76;212933,76;H2020-MSCA-IF-2019;MSCA-IF-EF-ST;"GENOME RESEARCH LIMITED";UK;;;

It focuses on path-breaking processes of legal innovation and concomitant political backlashes taking place in Brazil, Spain and Portugal in order to offer a singular comparative approach and to provide empirically informed theoretical insights that are relevant for ongoing debates in the intersections among gender and queer studies.
Rooted in the field-defining works of moral and political philosophers, recent feminist scholarship and queer theorists have shown the need for interdisciplinary approaches to biopolitical studies. Drawing in this dense intersection between social sciences and the humanities, the proposed research focuses in three countries pertaining to the European and the global south whose recent history is marked by the transition to democratic regimes in which profound transformations of the biopolitics of kinship, gender and reproduction took place over a rather brief period of time. In this sense, the proposed research constitutes an original response to influent criticisms coming from sexuality studies urging a de-centering of the academic focus away from the global north in order to retain the very political impulse of field-defining concepts such as sexual and intimate citizenship. 
More specifically, the project comprises one main strand to be conducted in Brazil –the country of primary focus– and 2 complementary strands in Spain and Portugal, where research will be enabled through secondments. All three strands are aimed at producing empirically informed discussions of emerging biopolitics with an emphasis in the state logics (e.g. political institutions, social policies, legislative and judicial provisions) involved in the overlapping fields of kinship, gender and reproduction as they unfold through emerging regulations of non-monogamous relationships, gender identity and third-party assisted reproduction.";237768;237768;H2020-MSCA-IF-2019;MSCA-IF-GF;"CENTRO DE ESTUDOS SOCIAIS";PT;;;

Exploring the effect of, and opportunities for, distributed human-machine situational awareness in en-route ATC operations is one of the main objectives of this project. Instead of automating isolated individual tasks, such as conflict detection or coordination, we propose building a foundation for automation by developing an intelligent situationally-aware system. Sharing the same team situational awareness among ATCO team members and AI will enable the automated system to reach the same conclusions as ATCOs when confronted with the same problem and to be able to explain the reasoning behind those conclusions. The challenges of transparency and generalization will be solved by combining machine learning with reasoning engine (including domain-specific knowledge graphs) in a way that emphasizes their advantages. Machine learning will be used for prediction, estimation and filtering at the level of individual probabilistic events, an area where it has so far shown great prowess, whereas reasoning engine will be used to represent knowledge and draw conclusions based on all the available data and explain the reasoning behind those conclusions.  We will explore to what extent it is possible to deduce machine learning false estimates and how resilient such system is to failure.

Since the 2000s, a number of parallel trends testify that the maternal health outcomes of non-white populations (i.e. Black, Hispanic, Caribbean, Asian, Middle East and Pacific Islander women) are worse than those of white women in Europe and the US. Among non-white populations, black women present the worst maternal health outcomes in both contexts. This has led some scholars to speak about a black maternal health crisis, drawing on facts such as black women undergoing a greater number of medical interventions and being more exposed to risks related to maternal health. However, black maternal health matters are poorly understood as a public health problem in Europe where there is little data collected by race and ethnicity. RiR will introduce new theories and new methods to advance the knowledge of black maternal health in Europe. The project will consist of two key activities: theoretical training in the US where I will explore Black Studies literature that is missing in Europe; and research work to be carried out in the US to reflect in a comparative way on black maternal health in Europe. The overarching aim is to explore the continuities and specificities of the black maternal health crisis in Europe (where I have worked and collected data on this topic for the last ten years) and in the US (where I will carry out new fieldwork). In addition to dissemination in the academe, RiR aims to spread its results to a broad public: medical professionals, reproductive rights associations and NGOs, public health and gender policy-makers.

The role of Aristotle's criticisms of Plato in the development of ancient Platonism";2020-09-01;2025-08-31;;"The conventional historiography of ancient Platonism follows patterns that ultimately go back to Antiquity itself. While these traditional doxographical accounts are not per se inaccurate, they do overlook continuities across different phases of this thousand-year history as well as some unexpected discontinuities. The reason for these shortcomings lies in the fact that certain philosophical debates are being ignored. Some omissions could be detected by searching for the philosophical reasons explaining doctrinal developments. 
This project chooses an unorthodox approach in that it does not try to reflect the issues emphasised in the sources, but instead selects one particular angle of approach: Aristotle’s critical discussion of Platonic views. By analysing Platonic responses to Aristotle’s criticisms and using these as a heuristic tool, the project pursues a twofold aim: to uncover debates that have hitherto not been picked up in scholarship; and to examine the philosophical reasons for doctrinal varieties and developments. The research hypothesis guiding this project is that Aristotle’s criticism of Platonic philosophy was a driving force for many developments in Platonism. 
The aims of the project can only be achieved through a large-scale investigation spanning the entire history of Platonism, searching for Platonic responses in all relevant philosophical domains. Since scholarship has been selective in its choice of topics, it cannot be predicted whether we can find sufficient traces of pertinent discussions in all subdomains. Despite the methodological difficulties and the uncertainty of the results the project is more than worth pursuing, as the pay-off is highly significant: it will radically change the way in which we understand the history of Platonism and add a whole new dimension to our historiographical accounts. If successful, it will uncover new debates and allow us to understand philosophical justifications for many philosophical developments.";2335911,25;2335911;ERC-2019-ADG;ERC-ADG;"KATHOLIEKE UNIVERSITEIT LEUVEN";BE;;;

Energy System Models (ESM) are tools that help energy analysts, planners and policy makers to rationally describe energy systems and systematically evaluate the impacts of long-term scenarios. On the supply side, ESMs have provided useful results, but  however, on the demand side, they lack the degree of accuracy required for proper characterization of, among others, the use of energy in households. One of the intrinsic difficulties is that energy demand in the residential sector is influenced by a myriad of factors (like the high diversity of dwellings, socio-economic conditions of the social/family units, and behavioral-related consumption patterns) that cannot easily be accounted for in traditional ESMs.
To overcome this challenge, the novel Causal Modeling will be used to quantitatively analyse human decision making in energy consumption and their reactions to interventions (e.g. policy changes). This will be combined with an innovative FFORMA approach which allows multiple

Although the genetic causes of ALS vary, the cytoplasmic accumulation of the TDP-43 protein in neurons is highly consistent among patients. Thus, TDP-43 is believed to be a point of convergence in the pathway responsible for ALS progression. However, while many genetic and cellular mechanisms have been linked to ALS, there is still a lack of understanding of the neuro-muscular interactions in ALS. In this project, we will identify neuronal or muscle cell-specific suppressors of motor impairment using an ALS model in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans. In this model, transgenic C. elegans overexpress TDP-43 in the neurons, resulting in severe motility defects. We will use optogenetic tools to excite neurons and muscle cells separately in the C. elegans ALS model, contributing to our understanding of how TDP-43 accumulation affects tissue function. In addition, live in vivo microscopy of C. elegans will help us to elucidate the impact of TDP-43 on neuro-muscular interactions over time. Furthermore, novel automated tracking of the nematode worms enables high-throughput analysis of C. elegans mobility. Thus, we can efficiently analyse mobility when TDP-43 is overexpressed, and use this tracking for high-throughput screening of mutants that rescue the ALS phenotype. Once we have identified the mutants that Rescue Motility Defects (RescueMoDe), we will characterize their impact on neuronal and muscular function. Therefore, it will be possible to analyse the tissue-specific role of these candidates, and how they fit into the progression of TDP-43 toxicity in this system. Overall, we aim to further the understanding of ALS progression, which will allow a highly informed continuation of studies in mammalian cell culture or in murine model systems, which may lead to therapeutic research opportunities.";175572,48;175572,48;H2020-MSCA-IF-2019;MSCA-IF-EF-ST;"ACADEMISCH ZIEKENHUIS GRONINGEN";NL;;;

The ecological traits of agricultural micro-organisms have made them an important target for patenting. Farmers' rights are an outcome of the recognition of the role of farmer communities in the evolution of crop varieties. Indigenous farmers have acted as selection agents in the development of crop as well as agricultural microbial resources by increasing reproductive fitness of particular genotypes. However, unlike with crop selection, no formal recognition of farmers' rights or potential benefit sharing programme has been proposed for agricultural micro-organisms that evolved from farming regimes. The central thesis that this project seeks to prove is that multilateral trade and environmental agreements  have failed in protecting the rights of indigenous farmers for their intellectual contribution in selection of beneficial agricultural biodiversity. The coming into force of TRIPS agreement and the Convention on Biological diversity has concretized the patenting regime of micro-organisms. In the absence of effective international and national legal enforcement, benefits are shared through mutually agreed contract arrangements which are invariably skewed against indigenous farmers. A commons approach to micro-organisms has potential to align farmers' rights on agricultural microbial resources with legal instruments developed for plant genetic resource collections.

In bringing the archaeological perspective of a 4200-year timespan, ANTHEA seeks to to radically alter our knowledge of resilient forms of self-organisation in past land-use regimes and human-nature entanglements. Based on seven case study areas, ANTHEA will show how collaborative institutions of common land use were organized in the North European heathland regimes (3200 BC-AD 1000), with a particular emphasis on their earliest emergence, their adaption to internal and external factors as well as their ecological, temporal, spatial, and social fabric. More than 4,000 years ago, farming communities across northern Europe began the first fire-based expansion of naturally occurring heather. Pollen evidence suggests that some of these grazing areas, spanning thousands of hectares, existed until the 18th-19th century. Without frequent intervention and management, anthropogenic heathland will turn into forest. So the survival of these areas suggests the existence of highly specialised forms of social organization with the unique capacity to persist. Still, we know little about the actual stability of these heathlands or what caused their unprecedented resilience. By shifting attention away from seeing institutional robustness as equilibrium, stability and continuity and placing the questions of instability, uncertainty, and areal flexibility at the centre, ANTHEA envisages a new cultural history of heathlands that breaks with rooted ideas of these areas being marginal and underdeveloped. ANTHEA is truly multidisciplinary and links landscape and settlement archaeology with paleoenvironmental modelling, social anthropology and philosophy. Moreover, the project introduces a pioneering theoretical and methodological advancement in the temporality of resilience, to be made usable in contemporary land-use policies. The long-term perspective will allow detailed historical trajectories to be established of how common land-use institutions emerged and reorganized according to changing circumstances, challenging the 'tragedy of the commons' narrative.'";1499457;1499457;ERC-2019-STG;ERC-STG;"AARHUS UNIVERSITET";DK;;;

Although this tendency is very positive concerning the targeted energy transition and for reaching the EU’s valuable 2030 climate and energy goals, the thousands of different decentralized power supply units connected in different parts of the grid, at different voltage levels and under different grid code standards challenge grid operators. The volatility of renewable energy generation (caused by weather conditions) and the need to balance power generation and demand within grids head to an oxymoron: although wind blows and sun shines, grid operators have to reactively curtail these plants from the grid to guarantee grid safety. Current control room systems are not made for a proactive and exact management and control of single assets  – limiting the share of renewable energies in our power mix to a lower level than it’s possible. 

To fully exploit the potential of clean and green energy by 100%, energy & meteo systems developed FuturePowerFlow, an algorithm-based, modular system which uses weather forecasts, locations of renewable energy plants, data on grid infrastructure, historic demand data and even operating status of plants (iced, under maintenance, etc) to predict power flows in the grid based on generation and consumption for the next 48h in very high time-resolution. Instead of reacting just demand driven, FuturePowerFlow enables grid operators for the first time ever to proactively plan and manage the integration of decentralized renewable assets into their grid and execute precise actions within one system.

FuturePowerFlow targets on a EUR 2.6bn energy market and is the perfect solution for transmission system operators and distribution system operators to manage their grids efficiently, directly targeting at and fulfilling their user needs.";2403750;1682625;H2020-EIC-SMEInst-2018-2020-3;SME-2b;"ENERGY & METEO SYSTEMS GMBH";DE;;;

Engineered thermometers take advantage of simple laws in which volume or electrical resistance vary linearly with temperature. Do similarly simple laws determine the temperature sensitivity of biological temperature sensors? The major objective of this project is to understand the physical mechanisms of temperature sensing of bacterial sodium channels, a model biological temperature sensor. To understand this mechanism three approaches will be taken: a bioinformatics approach to reveal any information evolution could tell us about the directed evolution of these sensors, a molecular dynamics approach to elucidate the molecular mechanism determining this temperature sensitivity, and finally the development of a coarse-grained computational model to allow transfer of the obtained results to other temperature sensors. A better understanding of biological temperature sensors has broad implications in the understanding of the potential effect of an increase in global temperature on plants and animals as well as in the design of pain therapeutics that target temperature-sensitive protein complexes in the human body. This highly interdisciplinary work is therefore expected to set the stage for improving the general understanding of biological temperature sensing, which, due to its relevance and wide-applicability, will subsequently enable to pursue my career as independent researcher.";162806,4;162806,4;H2020-MSCA-IF-2019;MSCA-IF-EF-ST;"MAX-PLANCK-GESELLSCHAFT ZUR FORDERUNG DER WISSENSCHAFTEN EV";DE;;;

This program is seen as having the potential to create a second, China-led internet, which splits from the US-centered one and is ruled by a different set of priorities and values. Are the Digital Silk Road and the global expansion of Chinese tech companies prefiguring a future with two internets: an existing one that is US-led and founded on market-driven ideology, and a new, alternative one that is China-led and characterized by state control, national boundaries, and national governance over what began as a borderless new space? What values and politics are built into the various components of the Digital Silk Road, and is - or how is - the internet they are creating fundamentally different from the current one? 

The project will employ qualitative and ethnographic methods, digital methods, and document analysis to understand the emergence of the Digital Silk Road from the ground-up and from the comparative perspective of business, governments, and ordinary people in four countries: China, where Digital Silk Road policies, finances, devices, online platforms and apps originate; Kazakhstan, a key player in Central Asia; Myanmar, whose economic dependence on China is the cause of considerable ambivalence; and Cambodia, that under Prime Minister Hun Sen has been one of the most enthusiastic supporters of Chinese investments.

The project aims at illuminating the deployment of the Digital Silk Road to see what this second internet might consist of; seeks to understand what values and politics are embedded in it; and explores how they are received and negotiated in the countries concerned, thus contributing to the wider debate on values, ethics, and technology.";1499236;1499236;ERC-2019-STG;ERC-STG;"KING'S COLLEGE LONDON";UK;;;

These features are of great relevance for the light harvesting applications as in photodiodes and photovoltaic cells. In this project, we propose to optimise the (opto-)electrical and photovoltaic behaviours of these components. The state-of-the-art ab-initio quantum transport solver relying on the density-functional theory and the Non-Equilibrium Green’s Function formalism will be employed to simulate the I-V characteristics of single- and multiple-junction vdWHs as well as their optoelectronic and photoresponse properties. Electron interactions with phonons and photons will be taken into account to ensure very accurate performance predictions. The validity of our models will be tested by comparing our results for vdWH-based devices with experimental data from our collaborators. These results will advance our understanding of the light-matter interaction in the atomistic scale vdWH junctions. We will then investigate whether the innovative idea of using the inter-layer carrier multiplication will lead to significant improvement of the light conversion efficiency of the photovoltaic cells. Novel vdWH-based superlattice photovoltaic cells will be designed and optimised with the precisely calibrated atomistic simulator. The most promising device configuration will serve as reliable design guidelines for our experimental collaborators so that the designed devices can be manufactured and characterised.

I propose to investigate emotion recognition using a statistical learning perspective in order to understand (i) why some emotions are harder to recognise than others; and (ii) why individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD individuals) have more difficulty recognising emotions than neurotypicals (i.e., individuals without autism).

I argue that part of the difficulty in recognising certain emotions lies in how reliable or consistent the auditory and visual cues are in signalling the emotion. That is, if particular cues consistently signal or have a high probability of signalling an emotion (e.g., 'happy' is consistently signaled by squinty eyes and grin/smile), then that emotion would be easier to recognise than emotions that are signalled by inconsistent cues (e.g., sarcasm may have varied expressions depending on the individual, context, etc. and so sarcasm would be more difficult to recognise). To investigate this, I will use an audio-visual emotion database that is currently under development to quantify the variability of cues across speakers in signalling the intended emotion.

I propose that the difficulty ASD individuals have with recognising emotions lies in a general difficulty with consolidating probabilistic information. In terms of emotion recognition, this would manifest as a difficulty with making a correct inference of the intended emotion given particular cues, which vary in their probabilities in signalling the emotion. To investigate this hypothesis, I will conduct a behavioural and a neural experiment comparing ASD individuals with neurotypicals on probabilistic learning to determine whether group differences exist and whether probabilistic learning is related to emotion recognition.

Outcomes of this project may inform intervention practices for ASD individuals and provide a general framework of understanding other ASD characteristics.";212933,76;212933,76;H2020-MSCA-IF-2019;MSCA-IF-EF-ST;"THE UNIVERSITY OF READING";UK;;;

For stateless applications, functionalities like load balancing (active-active), failover (active-passive), and job continuity (roaming) are easily addressable at the network level. For stateful applications though, the developers must provision a clustered data layer for managing the ever-growing collections of geographically spread data. This layer needs to provide geo-transparent data access, integrate well with the interplay of backend services, and be tailored (described by structure and purpose and expressed in functionality) to the specific application requirements. 

Over the last few years, research efforts are mainly focused on security, privacy, confidentiality, energy efficiency, and reliability of storage systems. An important aspect that has not been thoroughly investigated yet is programmability. To keep pace with the increasing birthday of new application models it is essential to pass the technological barrier of 'programming storage systems' and enter the age of 'composing storage systems'.  So far, no competent solution has been proposed either by industry or academia. 

Herein, we propose an open-source development ecosystem intended for engineers and researchers looking to invent, build, verify, evaluate, and release storage systems, tailored on a per-application basis. The ecosystem, called Ether, consists of i) the virtualized storage platform for managing application state whose data are spread across heterogeneous services provided by third-party vendors ii) the virtualization framework for specifying the control flows and the data management of the platform, as hierarchies of virtual functions iii) and the community hub for sharing virtual functions, platform configurations, or best practises.";153085,44;153085,44;H2020-MSCA-IF-2019;MSCA-IF-EF-ST;"IDRYMA TECHNOLOGIAS KAI EREVNAS";EL;;;
